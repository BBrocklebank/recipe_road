# Recipe Road

## README
<hr>


#### Project Goals/Target Audience
<hr>
Recipe road is an online, user contributed cookbook. Designed around the basis that users will contribute the majority of content, its core function is to host and share recipes for enjoyment and education. The focus of the site will be to encourage diversity and exploration of different cultures diets and cuisines through the categorisation of each recipe uploaded. Second to this the monetary aim of the site is to promote the use of own brand cooking appliances. This will be achieved by suggesting appliances when matched with an appropriate recipe. Required input fields for recipe requirements will ensure each upload has a list of appliances suggested.
<br>  <br>
The sites main goals are to attract users seeking new and interesting recipes as well as those who wish to share their own. By providing natural visual representation of cuisines and recipes available on the site it is hoped that this will spark interest and exploration. The intended result of this exploration is returning users and continued user generated content. In turn this will keep the site feeling fresh and active, whilst subtly pressing the product range.
<br>   <br>
Recipe Roads target audience is recommended at ages 12+, with no specific background, cultural distinction or qualifications being of any concern or consideration. The almost universal requirement to cook and enjoy food should provide ample attractiveness to the use base of the site. This coupled with the availability of more exotic products in supermarkets means people, generally, are open to and cooking more diverse cuisines, delivering a healthy user base for the Recipe Road.

## Design

### Design Choices

Beginning this stage by researching other available recipe sites I began to make a list of desirable design aspects I wanted to be included. High priority was placed on simplicity, as not to overwhelm the user with information. The use of pale colour shades stood out as a fine way to draw the user in to select information with brighter text tones, avoiding eye fatigue. The importance of symmetry became apparent during the design stage, allowing for more information on screen without a cluttered feel.

Interactivity needed to be simple and precise, one should be able to understand site navigation and controls intuitively. Large clear buttons have been adopted to aid those using small screens and/or the visually impaired. Basic instructions are applied in the form of suggestion and required fields on forms. All labels are appropriate and where a label hasn’t been used an aria-label has been, adhering to accessibility standards.

To fulfil the discovery and search aspect of the site a distinct search bar was devised and implemented to allow users to freely search all of the sites content. There’s clear search and reset buttons available for navigating away from a search without the need to reload the page.

Following the path of simplicity care has been taken to allow the user to edit their own details and update their information. A user can update their first and second names, username and email all from their profile without the need to load another page. This provides a stable and fluid experience.
<br>
<br>

### Sketches

These sketches were created at the very initial design phase following research. They represent idealised version of the site and include some concepts that did not make it into the final project. This is due to various reasons such as time constraints, feature priority and expereince/time effectivness.

### Wireframes

The following wireframes were constructed within Balsamiq(link this) during the Scope Plane section of the design and planning stage for this project. They represent an early design concept that has largely been kept to through to final product. However do note that they vary slightly from the final design, this is due to practical considerations that arose during the surface plane stage. Some design aspects were altered due to time constraints and practical limitations however I feel the main aim of the project has been realised.

### Colours

Colours used were meticulusly selected after research reveal text heavy sites often lend a strong contrast between background and text. Observing other sites such as all recipes it was clear that a clean, soft pallet background enabled more engaging text colours.

As seen colours assigned to the background are a soft yellow/grey. This couple with the bright red nav text and recipe collapsibles provides strong contrast.

Once opened the background becomes white with black text, as staple and strong way to provide information without making the scren feel cluttered.


### Fonts

For this project fonts were left as default as they were quite adequate to portray information. The main focus is the information and this is where I wanted the used to be drawn, having clear and concise appearance was more than enough.

### Styling

The general site layout is simple by design, drawing in the users attention with bright colours to areas of naviagtional interest. Important information is left clear and unintruded.

The edit forms are clean and to the point, little styling makes it a simple affair to fill in the required fields and submit. Likewise editing user profile details follows the same suit.

## Js Game Code

Significant bugs were detected during the process of developing this section of the project. During the making of this I kept a small journal noting all bugs that I encounterd and how I solved them. These correlate with the bug fixed committed during development.

### Bugs List - Check commits for BUG-comparison images

1. No href on signup dropdown link meant cursor didn’t change to pointed hand

2. Jquery image locations not accurate, switch to vanilla js

3. .each  jQuery no index number to use, changed to vanilla js loop to assign index to cards for identification

4. jQuery event listener wouldn’t pass card variable data. Assigned to new variable and passed this

5. Wrong array in if statement of check cards (using id array instead of name). As ids are different for each card, would never display correct match

6. Matched cards would show again if clicked, removed event listeners before adding them with .click to stop this

8. Attempting to display matched cards score before cards have been added to matchedCards array, fix, relocate code to after event/required placeholder text as score displays code within function/if statement so no display beforehand

9. Grid select changed class of grid div, grid select ceased to function. Added id to grid div and added set class attribute for each difficulties grid select function.

10. Selecting difficulties would place all images elements into div along with last used, overwhelming page. Cleared grid html to prevent this.

11. Cards could be flipped from moment of load, prevented this by only adding event listeners when start is clicked

12. start button triggering every all dif functions, added key system to only trigger desired functions

13. selecting difficulty then wouldn’t let you select it. Fixed by wiping opposing control arrays within dif functions

14. Added conditional statements to prevent start button triggering dif timer and event listeners unless that level was explicitly chosen

15. Selecting same card would cause match alert, added conditional to check cardId isn’t the same

16. Mixing vanilla javascript and jQuery in same line of code to remove event listeners didn’t work

17. dif one not being invoked on load, moved call to end of js file

18. ## jQuery event click array causing multiple functions calls, cleared event listeners before adding in each dif function. This bug took considerable time to discover within debugger due to it's embedded nature within jQuery itself and not the code I had written on surface level.


## Js Email Code

This section code didn't require many fixes, it was the quickest and smoothest part of development no doubt to the abundance of documentation available for EmailJS. As such no bugs were encountered. Some issues occured with naming finctions but these were trivial issues.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

## User Stories

### First Time User Goals (adult)

- As a first time user, I want to easily ascertain the main purpose of the application and its value to me.

- Upon entering the site, the user is presented with a clear grid and instructions from which to determine the use of the site and what it can do for them.

- As a first time user, I want to easily interact with the application and its controls, visibly receiving feedback.

- Each button provides feedback to the user and all tiles change appearance when clicked upon. Alert modals provide feedback when making a correct or incorrect match as well as time running out or completing the game.

- As a first time user, I wish to see exciting images and animations that draw me into the application further.

- The game has a vibrant colour scheme that reveals itself when clicking the black cards to reveal contrasting colours with lettering.

- As a first time user, I want to be entertained whilst using the application.

- The score display and countdown are design to give a small sense of urgency and challenge. This should keep the pace high and the fun continuous.
<br>
<br>

### Returning User Goals (adult)

  As a returning user I wish to beat my previous score/time.

- Easy reset of the game means a user can actively play again and again and beat their previous score or time.

- As a returning user I wish to improve my short term memory performance.

- A requirement of the game is the use of short term memory. Repeated use will inherently improve this and the varying difficulty only improve this further.

- As a returning user I want to know if there are any more games I can access by the same developer.

- A newsletter modal as well as feedback contact page allow users to contact the developer as well as getting updates to their inbox.
<br>
<br>

### Frequent User Goals (adult)

- As a frequent user, I want to be able to raise the difficulty to keep the game engaging.

- This is provided in the form of more cards to match in the same amount of time provide an adequate challenge.

- As a frequent user, I want to provide feedback to the developer on improvements and potential new features.

- Feedback can be provided through the contact page which allows questions and feedback.
<br>
<br>

### User (child)

- I wish the game to be aesthetically appealing and interesting, gaining my attention.

- Bright primary colours when cards flip provide excitement and interest as they reveal themselves against the black of the other cards. Matched cards disappear creating a sense that you wish to clear them all.

- Controls should be obvious and visibly displayed to me in some way.

- Simple start and reset buttons as well as simple controls to tap/click to match cards easy to follow. Game feedback modals also aid this.

- I should be able to pick a difficulty.

- This is provided through the three options available with the third proving quite a challenge.

- Should be in some way new each time I play.

- The cards are randomised each time a used plays and with the lowest number of cards being 12 this provides hundreds of variations up to thousands of assortments on the top level.
<br>
<br>

### Developer Goals

- As a developer, I want new users to engage with the application and enjoy it.

- The bug free application along with easy intuitive controls and difficulty levels is in good standing to provide entertainment and engagement to users.

- As a developer, I want users to return to improve their scores and times.

- The differing levels and score/time display within the game enhance the sense of competitiveness and this in turn can drive improvement.

- As a developer, I wish users to improve their short term memory performance.

- Repeated use of the game will inherently improve this without the users knowledge.

- As a developer, I want returning users to provide feedback on improvements/features they
 wish to see.

- The clearly labelled contact page and signup modal both offer a way for the developer and user to interact with each other even if not directly. Signing up for the newsletter might lead to a contact submission if questions arise from an update.

- As a developer, I want returning users to signup for announcements and future projects.

- Signup modal is clearly displayed on each page and has a unique colour to draw the users to it.
